This role should help with installing Virtio Windows drivers
and spice-guest-tools:

* Virtio Network Driver ([netkvm](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/NetKVM))
* Virtio Block Driver ([viostor](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/viostor))
* QXL Graphics Driver (qxldod)
* VirtIO SCSI pass-through controller Driver ([vioscsi](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/vioscsi))
* Baloon Driver ([Balloon](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/Balloon))
* Virtio RNG driver ([viorng](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/viorng))
* Virtio serial driver ([vioserial](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/vioserial))
* Virtio Input driver ([vioinput](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/vioinput))
* pvpanic device driver ([pvpanic](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/tree/master/pvpanic))
* Qemu Guest Agent ([qemu-ga-x86_64](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Qemu_guest_agent))
* SPICE Guest Tools ([vdagent-win](https://www.spice-space.org))

It's handy if you are running Windows on the KVM hypervisor, because you will
get the best performance using VirtIO drivers + tools.
